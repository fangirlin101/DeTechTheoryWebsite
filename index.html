<h1> About </h1>

<p1><span style="font-size:17px;"><span style="letter-spacing:0.05em;"> DeTech Theory's goal is to make computer science accessible to all. Although many people are interested in programming, it is a frustrating subject to teach yourself. Trying to find an online course is also difficult, and the choice between cost and quality is rarely easy.
   DeTech Theory's course, created for aspiring programmers, by individuals who have each taken various programming courses aims to eliminate these obstacles. Covering all topics in AP Computer Science A and the ICSE Computing Applications Exam, our FREE Introduction to Computer Science course prioritizes creativity and ease of education for our students.
